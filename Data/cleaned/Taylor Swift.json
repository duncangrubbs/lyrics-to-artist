We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.\n\nThis is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.\n\nThe point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.\n\nWhen this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?\n\nLet me say it again, louder for those in the back...\n\nWe think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.\n\nThere will be no further explanation.\nThere will be just reputation.", "[Verse 1]\nI'm walking fast through the traffic lights\nBusy streets and busy lives\nAnd all we know, is touch and go\nWe are alone with our changing minds\nWe fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I never saw you coming\nAnd I\u2019ll never be the same\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou come around and the armor falls\nPierce the room like a cannon ball\nNow

yourself.\n\nIf you're anything like me\nYou've grown to hate your pride\nTo love your thighs\nAnd no amount of friends at 25\nWill fill the empty seats\nAt the lunch tables of your past\nThe teams

crazy, running wild, wild\nCan't remember what song it was playing when we walked in\nThe night we snuck into a yacht club party\nPretending to be a duchess and a prince\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I said, \"Oh, my, what a marvelous tune\"\nIt was the best night, never would forget how we moved\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\nLike we're made of starlight,

thinking that way\"\nHe was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me\n\"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?\nDon't you dream impossible things?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nLike, \"Oh, my, what a marvelous tune\"\nIt was the best night, never would forget how we moved\nThe whole place was dressed to the nines\nAnd we were dancing, dancing\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\nLike we're made of starlight, starlight\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh, ooh, he's talking crazy\nOoh, ooh, dancing with me\nOoh, ooh, we could get married\nHave ten kids and teach 'em how to dream\n\n[Guitar

can know so much\nWithout knowing anything at all\nAnd now that I can put this down\nIf I had known what I know now\nI never would've played so nonchalant\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nTaxi cabs and busy streets\nThat never bring you back to me\nI can't help but wish you took me with you\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd this is when the feeling sinks in\nI don't wanna miss you like this\nCome back, be here, come

I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes, you know? It's like a kaleidoscope of memories, it just all comes back. But he never does. I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen. It's not really anything he said or anything he did, it was the feeling that came along with it. And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again, but I don't know if I should. I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you? Maybe he knew that when he saw me. I guess I just lost my balance. I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him, it was losing me.", "[Verse 1]\nLoving him is like\nDriving a new Maserati down a dead end street\nFaster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly\nLoving him is like\nTrying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall\nLike the colors in autumn\nSo bright, just before they lose it all\n\n[Chorus]\nLosing him was blue like I'd never known\nMissing him was dark grey, all alone\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met\nBut loving him was red\nLoving him was red\n\n[Verse 2]\nTouching him was like\nRealizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you\nMemorizing him was as\nEasy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song\nFighting with him was like\nTrying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer\nRegretting him was like\nWishing you never found out that love could be that strong\n\n[Chorus]\nLosing him was blue like I'd never known\nMissing him was dark grey, all alone\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met\nBut loving him was red\nOh, red\nBurning red\n\n[Bridge]\nRemembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes\nTell myself it's time now, gotta let go\nBut moving on from him is impossible\nWhen I still see it all in my head\nIn burning red\nBurning, it was red\n\n[Chorus]\nLosing him was blue like I'd never known\nMissing him was dark grey, all alone\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met\n'Cause loving him was red\nYeah, yeah, red\nWe're burning red\n\n[Breakdown]\nAnd that's why he's spinning 'round in my head\nComes back to me, burning red\n\n[Outro]\nHis love was like\nDriving a new Maserati down a dead end street"]}
