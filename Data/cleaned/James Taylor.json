thought that I'd see you again\n\n[Verse 2]\nWon't you look down upon me, Jesus\nYou've got to help me make a stand\nYou've just got to see me through another day\nMy body's aching and my time is at hand\nAnd I won't make it any other way\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain\nI've seen sunny days that I thought would never end\nI've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend\nBut I always thought that I'd see you again\n\n[Verse 3]\nBeen walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun\nLord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around\nWell, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come\nSweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain\nI've seen sunny days that I thought would never end\nI've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend\nBut I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again,
