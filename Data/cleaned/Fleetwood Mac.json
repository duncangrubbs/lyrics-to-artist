{"Fleetwood Mac": ["[Intro]\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow here you go again, you say you want your freedom\nWell, who am I to keep you down?\nIt's only right that you should play the way you feel it\nBut listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLike a heartbeat drives you mad\nIn the stillness of remembering what you had\nAnd what you lost and what you had and what you lost\n\n[Chorus]\nThunder only happens when it's raining\nPlayers only love you when they're playing\nSay women they will come and they will go\nWhen the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know\n\n[Bridge]\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow here I go again, I see the crystal visions\nI keep my visions to myself\nIt's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams\nAnd have you any dreams you'd like to sell?\nDreams of loneliness\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLike a heartbeat drives you mad\nIn the stillness of remembering what you had\nAnd what you lost and what you had, oh, what you lost\n\n[Chorus]\nThunder only happens when it's raining\nPlayers only love you when they're playing\nWomen they will come and they will go\nWhen the rain washes you clean, you'll know\nOh, thunder only happens when it's raining\nPlayers only love you when they're playing\nSay women they will come and they will go\nWhen the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know\nYou will know, you'll know"]}
