# Lyric Classification with Deep Neural Networks
> Final Project for DIS Spring 2020: Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## ðŸ“š Intro
Every writer has a style. Part of the keys to becoming a well-known and respected writer is honing that style and creating something entirely unique to you and your life experience. Music, as an art form, allows for an entirely unique form of expression, and some artists are truly peerless in their writing. As students that love music, and have seen what neural networks have been able to do with text classification, we wanted to test the boundaries of such a network.

Our goal through this Neural Networks project was to see if a network could find and reveal that style, and be able to predict who had written a selection of lyrics. The idea as that, given enough data, the model could be trained on the lyrics of a popular artist, and be able to classify later inputs as the given artist.
