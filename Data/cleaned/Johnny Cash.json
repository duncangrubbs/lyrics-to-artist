filled with torture my body's in pain\nBut the needle is warm as it sinks in my vein\nJust a matter of seconds then my mind will be free\nFrom the coldness and darkness that dominate me\n\nBut the freedom is short lived and then I'm alone\nI must find the pusher but my money's all gone\nThen the cycle of horror starts over once more\nOh God, let me suffer this misery no more",

slumbering\nTik,tok,tik,tok\nHis life seconds numbering\nTik,tok,tik,tok\nIt stopped, short never to go again\nWhen the old man died\nMy grandfather said that of those he could hire\nNot a servant so faithful he found\nFor it wasted no time and had but one desire\nAt the close of each week to be wound\nAnd it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face\nAnd its hands never hung by its side\nBut it stopped short, never to go again\nWhen the old man died\nIt rang and alarmed in the dead of the night\nAn alarm that for years had been dumb\nAnd we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight\nThat his hour for departure had come\nStill the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime\nAs we silently stood by his side\nBut it stopped short, never to go again\nWhen the old man

about a dozen babies, John Henry's papie told tale about a dozen times\nThe babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money, he said I'll pay you quarter at a time, startin' tomorow, that's the pay for a steel driver on this line\nThen the section foreman said hey hammer swinger, I see you brought your own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do?\nAnd he said, I can turn a jack, I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too\n(can you swing a hammer boy?)\nI can I'll do anything you hire me to\nNow ain't you something so high and mighty with your muscles, just go ahead pick up that hammer, pick up the hammer\nHe said get a rusty spike and swing it down three times, I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to, go on and do what you say you can do\nWith a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel, John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels, then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two, 35 cents a day for driven steel\n(sweat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings)\nI was born for driven steel\nWell John Henry hammered in the mountain, he'd give a grunt and he'd give groan with every swing, the women folks for miles around, heard him and come down, to watch him make the cold steel ring, Lord what a swinger, just listen to that cold steel ring\nBut the bad boss come up laughing at John Henry, said you full of vinegar now, but you bout through, were gonna get a steam drill to do your share of drivin, then what's all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry, gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you\nJohn Henry said I feed four little brothers, and my baby sister's walking on her knees, did the Lord say that machines awtta take the place of living, and what's a subsitute for bread and beans, I ain't seen it, do engines get rewarded for their steam\nJohn Henry hid in a coal mine for his dinner now, had thirty minutes to rest before the bell, the mine boss hollered get up whoever you are and get a pick ax, give me enough coal to start another hill, and keep it burning, mine me enough to start another hill\nJohn Henry said to his captain, a man ain't nothin but a man, but if you bring that steam drill round, I'll beat it fair and honest, I'll die with my hammer in my hand, but I'll be laughing, cuz you can't replace a steel driven man\nThere was a big crowd of people at the mountain, John Henry said to the steam drill how is you, pardon me mister steam drill, I suppose you didn't hear me, I said how you, well can you turn a jack, can you lay a track, can you pick and shovel too, listen this hammer swingers talkin' to you\n2000 people hollered go John Henry, then somebody hollered the mountain's caving in, John Henry told the captain, tell the kind folks not to worry, that ain't nothin but my hammer suckin' wind, keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle I intend\nCaptain tell the people move back further, I'm at the finish line and I ain't no drill, she's so far behind you ain't got the brains to quit it, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, Lord Lordy, when she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills\nWell John Henry had a little woman, I believe the lady's name was Polly Ann, yeah that was his good woman, John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home, he layed down to rest his weary back and early next morining he said come here Polly Ann come here sugar, ya know I believe this is the first time I ever watched the sun come up that I couldn't come up with it\nTake my hammer Polly Ann and go to that rail road, swing that hammer like you seen me do it, and when your swinging with the lead men, they'll all know they'll all know your John Henry's woman, but tell them that's not all I can do, tell em I can hoist a jack, and I can lay a track, I can pick and shovel too, ain't no machine can, that's been proved to you\nThere was a big crowd of mourners at the church house, the section hands laid him in the sand, trains go by on the rails John Henry laid, they slow down and take off their hats, the men do, when they come to the palce John Henrys laid, rests on his back, some say mornin steel driver you sure were a hammer swinger, then they go along pickin up speed, clikty clak, clikty clak, down there lies a steel driven man oh Lord, down there lies a steel driven man, down there lies a steel

headlights and that dashboard in my mind\nThe first time I heard Johnny Cash sing I Walk The Line\n\n[Hook 2: Johnny Cash]\nI find it very very easy to be true\nI find myself alone when each day's through\nYes I'll admit that I'm a fool for you\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line\n\n[Guitar Solo: Johnny Cash]\nAh, skinny pack\n(Mmmmmmmmmmm)\n\n[Verse 4: Rodney Crowell]\nAll these long years later it's still music to my ears\nI swear it sounds as good right now as anything I hear\nI've seen the Mona Lisa, I've heard Shakespeare read real fine\nJust like hearing Johnny Cash sing I Walk The Line\n\n[Hook 3: Johnny Cash]\nAs sure as night is dark and day is light\nI keep you on my mind both day and night\nAnd happiness I've known proves that it's right\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line\n\n[Outro: Johnny Cash]\nBecause you're mine, I walk the line"]}
