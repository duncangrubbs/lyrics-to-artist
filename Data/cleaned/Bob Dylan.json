all!\u201d\nHere comes the story of the Hurricane\nThe man the authorities came to blame\nFor something that he never done\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\nThe champion of the world\n\n[Verse 2]\nThree bodies lying there does Patty see\nAnd another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it,\u201d he says, and he throws up his hands\n\u201cI was only robbing the register, I hope you understand\nI saw them leaving,\u201d he says, and he stops\n\u201cOne of us had better call up the cops\u201d\nAnd so Patty calls the cops\nAnd they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing\nIn the hot New Jersey night\n\n[Verse 3]\nMeanwhile, far away in another part of town\nRubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around\nNumber one contender for the middleweight crown\nHad no idea what kinda shit was about to go down\nWhen a cop pulled him over to the side of the road\nJust like the time before and the time before that\nIn Paterson that\u2019s just the way things go\nIf you\u2019re black you might as well not show up on the street\nUnless you want to draw the heat\n\n[Verse 4]\nAlfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops\nHim and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around\nHe said, \u201cI saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights\nThey jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates\u201d\nAnd Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head\nCop said, \u201cWait a minute, boys, this one\u2019s not dead\u201d\nSo they took him to the infirmary\nAnd though this man could hardly see\nThey told him that he could identify the guilty men\n\n[Verse 5]\nFour in the morning and they haul Rubin in\nTake him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs\nThe wounded man looks up through his one dying eye\nSays, \u201cWhy did you bring him in here for?

champion of the world\n\n[Verse 6]\nFour months later, the ghettos are in flame\nRubin\u2019s in South America, fighting for his name\nWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley\u2019s still in the robbery game\nAnd the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame\n\u201cRemember that murder that happened in a bar?\u201d\n\u201cRemember you said you saw the getaway car?\u201d\n\u201cYou think you\u2019d like to play ball with the law?\u201d\n\u201cThink it might-a been that fighter that you saw running that night?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that you are white\u201d\n\n[Verse 7]\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, \u201cI\u2019m really not sure\u201d\nCops said, \u201cA poor boy like you could use a break\nWe got you for the motel job and we\u2019re talking to your friend Bello\nNow you don\u2019t want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow\nYou\u2019ll be doing society a favor\nThat sonofabitch is brave and getting braver\nWe want to put his ass in stir\nWe want to pin this triple murder on him\nHe ain\u2019t no Gentleman Jim\u201d\n\n[Verse 8]\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much\n\"It\u2019s my work,\" he\u2019d say, \"and I do it for pay\nAnd when it\u2019s over I\u2019d just as soon go on my way\"\nUp to some paradise\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\nAnd ride a horse along a trail\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse\nWhere they try to turn a man into a mouse\n\n[Verse 9]\nAll of Rubin\u2019s cards were marked in advance\nThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance\nThe judge made Rubin\u2019s witnesses drunkards from the slums\nTo the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger\nAnd though they could not produce the gun\nThe D.A. said he was the one who did the deed\nAnd the all-white jury agreed\n\n[Verse 10]\nRubin Carter was falsely tried\nThe crime was murder \u201cone,\u201d guess who testified?\nBello and Bradley and they both baldly lied\nAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride\nHow can the life of such a man\nBe in the palm of some fool\u2019s hand?\nTo see him obviously framed\nCouldn\u2019t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land\nWhere justice is a game\n\n[Verse 11]\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\nAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell\nAn innocent man in a living hell\nThat\u2019s the story of the Hurricane\nBut it won\u2019t be over till they clear his name\nAnd give him back the time he\u2019s done\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\nThe champion of the world", "[Verse 1]\nWell it ain't no use

knowed\nAnd it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe\nI\u2019m on the dark side of the road\nBut I wish there was something you would do or say\nTo try and make me change my mind and stay\nBut we never did too much talking anyway\nBut don\u2019t think twice, it\u2019s all right\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal\nLike you never done before\nAnd it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal\nI can\u2019t hear you anymore\nI\u2019m a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road\nI once loved a woman, a child I\u2019m told\nI gave her my heart but she wanted my soul\nBut don\u2019t think twice, it\u2019s all right\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo long, honey babe\nWhere I\u2019m bound, I can\u2019t tell\nGoodbye's too good a word, babe\nSo I\u2019ll just say fare thee well\nI ain't a-saying you treated me unkind\nYou could've done better, but I don\u2019t mind\nYou just kinda wasted my precious time\nBut don\u2019t think twice, it\u2019s all right", "[Chorus]\nHey

beach\nFar from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow\nYes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free\nSilhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands\nWith all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves\nLet me forget about today until tomorrow\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me\nI'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to\nHey Mr. Tambourine Man,

fall\n\n[Verse 5]\nAnd what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?\nAnd what will you do now, my darling young one?\nI\u2019m a-going back out \u2019fore the rain starts a-falling\nI\u2019ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest\nWhere the people are many and their hands are all empty\nWhere the pellets of poison are flooding their waters\nWhere the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison\nAnd the executioner\u2019s face is always well hidden\nWhere hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten\nWhere black is the color, where none is the number\nAnd I\u2019ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it\nAnd reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it\nThen I\u2019ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking\nBut I\u2019ll know my song well before I start singing\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard, it\u2019s a hard, and it\u2019s a hard\nIt\u2019s a hard rain\u2019s a-going to fall", "They\u2019re selling postcards of the

the spotlight, so clear\nAnd later on, when the crowd thinned out\nI was just about to do the same\nShe was standing there, in back of my chair\nSaid to me \"Tell me, don't I know your name?\"\nI muttered something underneath my breath\nShe studied the lines on my face\nI must admit, I felt a little uneasy\nWhen she bent down to tie the laces\nOf my shoe\nTangled up in blue\n\n[Verse 5]\nShe lit a burner on the stove\nAnd offered me a pipe\n\"I thought you'd never say hello\" she said\n\"You look like the silent type\"\nThen she opened up a book of poems\nAnd handed it to me\nWritten by an Italian poet\nFrom the thirteenth century\nAnd every one of them words rang true\nAnd glowed like burning coal\nPouring off of every page\nLike it was written in my soul\nFrom me to you\nTangled up

me\nHe\u2019s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all\nMuttering small talk at the wall while I\u2019m in the hall\nHow can I explain?\nIt's so hard to get on\nAnd these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn\n\nInside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial\nVoices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while\nBut Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues\nYou can tell

binoculars hang from the head of the mule\nBut these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel\n\nThe peddler now speaks to the countess who\u2019s pretending to care for him\nSayin\u2019,

prepares for him\nAnd Madonna, she still has not showed\nWe see this empty cage now corrode\nWhere her cape of the stage once had flowed\nThe fiddler, he now steps to the road\nHe writes ev\u2019rything\u2019s been returned which was owed\nOn the back of the fish truck that loads\nWhile my conscience explodes\nThe harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain\nAnd these visions of Johanna are now all that remain", "[Verse 1]\nYou must leave now\nTake what you need, you think will last\nBut whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast\nYonder stands your orphan with his

melody\nLike all tough sailors do\nWhen they're far away at sea\n\n\"I think I'll call it America\"\nI said as we hit land\nI took a deep breath\nI fell down, I could not stand\nCaptain Arab he started\nWriting up some deeds\nHe said, \"Let's set up a fort\nAnd start buyin' a place with beads\"\nJust then this cop comes down the street\nCrazy as a loon\nHe throws us all in jail\nFor carrying harpoons\n\nAh, me I busted out\nDon't even ask me how\nI went to get some help\nI walked by a Guernsey cow\nWho directed me down\nTo the Bowery slums\nWhere people carried signs around\nSayin', \"Ban

exploded\nFrom boilin' fat\nFood was flyin' everywhere\nI left without my hat\n\nNow, I didn't mean to be nosy\nBut I went into a bank\nTo get some bail for Arab\nAnd all the boys back in the

knocked me out\nAnd robbed my boots\nAnd I was on the street again\n\nWell, I rapped upon a house\nWith the US flag upon display\nI said, \"Could you help me out\nI got some friends down the way\"\n\"The man says, \"Get out of here\nI'll tear you limb from limb\"\nI said, \"You know they refused Jesus, too\"\nHe said, \"You're not Him\nGet out of here before I break your bones\nI ain't

didn't drive a truck\nHe said his name was Columbus\nI just said, \"Good luck\"", "Well, I ride on a mail train, baby\nCan't buy a thrill\nWell, I been up all night\nLeanin' on the windowsill\nWell,

everyone,\u201d he said\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads\nThen he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin\n\u201cCould you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?\u201d\nThen he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 3]\nBackstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs\nLily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair\nOutside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide\nA gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside\nLily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 4]\nBig Jim was no one\u2019s fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine\nHe made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 5]\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town\nShe slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear\n\u201cSorry, darling, that I\u2019m late,\u201d but he didn't seem to hear\nHe was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 6]\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve seen that face somewhere,\u201d Big Jim was thinking to himself\n\u201cMaybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody\u2019s shelf\u201d\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him\nStaring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 7]\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled\nShe had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere\nBut she\u2019d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 8]\nThe hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined\nThe drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim\u2019s ring\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king\nNo, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 9]\nRosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim\u2019s wife\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide\nWas looking to do just one good deed before she died\nShe was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 10]\nLily took her dress off, buried it away\n\u201cHas your luck run out?\u201d she laughed at him, \u201cWell, I guess you must\nHave known it would someday\nBe careful not to touch the wall, there\u2019s a brand-new coat of paint\nI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re still alive, you\u2019re looking like a saint\u201d\nDown the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 11]\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair\n\u201cThere\u2019s something funny going on,\u201d he said, \u201cI can just feel it in the air\u201d\nHe went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 12]\nNo one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked\nAnd Big Jim was standing there, ya couldn't say surprised\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes\nShe was with Big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 13]\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it\u2019s said that they got off with quite a haul\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\nFor one more member who had business back in town\nBut they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 14]\nThe next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink\nThe hanging judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink\nThe only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts\n\n[Verse 15]\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said, \u201cClosed for repair\u201d\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair\nShe was thinking \u2019bout her father, who she very rarely saw\nThinking \u2019bout Rosemary and thinking about the law\nBut most of all she was thinking \u2019bout the Jack of Hearts", "When your mother sends back all your invitations\nAnd your

never thinks straight\n'Bout the shape that he\u2019s in\nBut it ain't him to blame\nHe\u2019s only a pawn in their game\n\nFrom the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks\nAnd the hoof beats pound in his brain\nAnd he\u2019s taught how to walk in a pack\nShoot in the back, with his fist in a clinch\nTo hang and to lynch\nTo hide 'neath the hood\nTo kill with no pain\nLike a dog on a chain\nHe ain't a-got no name\nBut it ain't him to blame\nHe\u2019s only a pawn in their game\n\nToday, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught\nThey lowered him down as a king\nBut when the shadowy sun sets on the one\nThat fired the gun\nHe\u2019ll see by his grave\nOn the stone that remains\nCarved next to his name\nHis epitaph plain\nOnly a pawn in their game", "[Chorus 1:

2]\nWell, when the pipeline gets broken\nAnd I'm lost on the river bridge\nI\u2019m all cracked up on the highway\nAnd in the water\u2019s edge\nHere again she comes, down the thruway\nReady to sew me

color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till\n\n[Verse 2]\nSome men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up\nThey said they had a reason, but I can't remember what\nThey tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat\nThere was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street\n\n[Verse 3]\nThen they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain\nAnd they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain\nThe reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it ain't no lie\nWas just for the fun of killing' him and to watch him slowly die\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd then to stop, the United States of yelling for a trial\nTwo brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till\nBut on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime\nAnd so this trial was a mockery, but nobody there seemed to mind\n\n[Verse 5]\nI saw the morning papers but I could not bear, to see\nThe smiling brothers walking' down the courthouse stairs\nFor the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free\nWhile Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea\n\n[Verse 6]\nIf you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust\nYour eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is filled with dust\nYour arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow\nFor you to let this human race fall down so God-awful low!\n\n[Verse 7]\nThis song's just a reminder to remind your fellow man\nThat this kind of thing still lives today

between sundown\u2019s finish and midnight\u2019s broken toll\nWe ducked inside the doorways, thunder went crashing\nAs majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds\nSeemin' to be the chimes

gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\n\n[Verse 2]\nThrough the city\u2019s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched\nWith faces hidden as the walls were tightening\nAs the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin\u2019 rain\nDissolved into the bells of the lightning\nTolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake\nTolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked\nTolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\n\n[Verse 3]\nThrough the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail\nThe sky cracked it's poems in naked wonder\nThat the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze\nLeavin' only bells of lightning and it's thunder\nStriking for the gentle, striking for the kind\nStriking for the guardians and protectors of the mind\nAnd the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales\nFor disrobed faceless forms of no position\nTolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts\nAll down in taken-for-granted situations\nTolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute\nFor the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute\nFor the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\n\n[Verse 5]\nEven though a cloud\u2019s white curtain in a far-off corner flared\nAnd the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting\nElectric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones\nCondemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'\nTolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail\nFor the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale\nAnd for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\n\n[Verse 6]\nStarry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught\nTrapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended\nAs we listened one last time and we watched with one last look\nSpellbound and swallowed \u2019til the tolling ended\nTolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed\nFor the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse\nAnd for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'", "[Verse 1]\nYour breath is

the fires of time\nI'd tried not to ever hurt anybody\nAnd to stay out of a life of crime\nAnd when it's all been said and done\nI never did know the score\nOne more day is another day away\nFrom the girl from the Red River Shore\n\n[Verse 6]\nWell, I'm a stranger here in a strange land\nBut I know this is where I belong\nI'll ramble and gamble for the one I love\nAnd the hills will give me a song\nThough nothing looks familiar to me\nI know I've stayed here before\nOnce, a thousand nights ago\nWith the girl from the Red River Shore\n\n[Verse 7]\nWell, I went back to see about her once\nWent back to straighten it out\nEverybody that I talked to had seen us there\nSaid they didn't know who I was talking about\nWell, the sun went down on me a long time ago\nI had to go back from the door\nI wish I could have spent every hour of my life\nWith the girl from the Red River Shore\n\n[Verse 8]\nNow I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago\nA man full of sorrow and strife\nThat if
